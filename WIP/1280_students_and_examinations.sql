Table: Students

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.
 

Table: Subjects

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
subject_name is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name of one subject in the school.
 

Table: Examinations

+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| student_id   | int     |
| subject_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.
Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.
 

Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.

The query result format is in the following example.

SELECT E.student_id, S.student_name, E.subject_name, IFNULL(COUNT(*),0) attended_exams
FROM Students S, Examinations E 
WHERE E.student_id = S.student_id
GROUP BY E.student_id, E.subject_name

Explanation: 
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.
Alex did not attend any exams.
John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.


-- My Answer 

WITH int_table AS 
(SELECT student_id, student_name, subject_name 
FROM Subjects, Students), 
enroll_count_table AS 
(SELECT E.student_id, E.subject_name, COUNT(*) AS attended_exams
FROM Examinations E
GROUP BY E.student_id, E.subject_name)

SELECT I.student_id, I.student_name, I.subject_name, IFNULL(E.attended_exams,0) attended_exams
FROM int_table I 
LEFT OUTER JOIN enroll_count_table E 
ON E.student_id = I.student_id
AND E.subject_name = I.subject_name
ORDER BY I.student_id, I.subject_name

-- What I Learned 
1) Use CROSS JOIN (SELECT FROM WITHOUT WHERE CLAUSE) to get a list of all the students & subjects

Write an SQL query to find the most frequently ordered product(s) for each customer.

The result table should have the product_id and product_name for each customer_id who ordered at least one order.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 
Example 1:

Input: 
Customers table:
+-------------+-------+
| customer_id | name  |
+-------------+-------+
| 1           | Alice |
| 2           | Bob   |
| 3           | Tom   |
| 4           | Jerry |
| 5           | John  |
+-------------+-------+
Orders table:
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| order_id | order_date | customer_id | product_id |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
| 1        | 2020-07-31 | 1           | 1          |
| 2        | 2020-07-30 | 2           | 2          |

| 6        | 2020-08-01 | 2           | 1          |
| 7        | 2020-08-01 | 3           | 3          |
| 8        | 2020-08-03 | 1           | 2          |
| 9        | 2020-08-07 | 2           | 3          |
| 10       | 2020-07-15 | 1           | 2          |
+----------+------------+-------------+------------+
Products table:
+------------+--------------+-------+
| product_id | product_name | price |
+------------+--------------+-------+
| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |
| 3          | screen       | 600   |
| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+
Output: 
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| customer_id | product_id | product_name |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
| 1           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 1          | keyboard     |
| 2           | 2          | mouse        |
| 2           | 3          | screen       |
| 3           | 3          | screen       |
| 4           | 1          | keyboard     |
+-------------+------------+--------------+
Explanation: 
Alice (customer 1) ordered the mouse three times and the keyboard one time, so the mouse is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Bob (customer 2) ordered the keyboard, the mouse, and the screen one time, so those are the most frequently ordered products for them.
Tom (customer 3) only ordered the screen (two times), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
Jerry (customer 4) only ordered the keyboard (one time), so that is the most frequently ordered product for them.
John (customer 5) did not order anything, so we do not include them in the result table.


-- My Answer 
WITH OrderCount AS 
(SELECT O.customer_id, O.product_id, COUNT(*) purchase_count
FROM Orders O
GROUP BY O.product_id, O.customer_id
ORDER BY O.customer_id, purchase_count DESC),
MaxTable AS 
(SELECT OC.customer_id, MAX(purchase_count) max_purchase
FROM OrderCount OC 
GROUP BY OC.customer_id)

SELECT OC.customer_id, OC.product_id, P.product_name
FROM OrderCount OC, Products P, MaxTable MT 
WHERE OC.purchase_count = MT.max_purchase 
AND OC.customer_id = MT.customer_id 
AND OC.product_id = P.Product_id 

-- Alternative Answer 
WITH OrderCount AS 
(SELECT O.customer_id, O.product_id, P.product_name, COUNT(*) purchase_count
FROM Orders O, Products P
WHERE O.product_id = P.product_id
GROUP BY O.product_id, O.customer_id
ORDER BY O.customer_id, purchase_count DESC),
RankTable AS 
(SELECT OC.customer_id, OC.product_id, OC.product_name, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY purchase_count DESC ) product_rank
FROM OrderCount OC)

SELECT customer_id, product_id, product_name
FROM RankTable
WHERE product_rank =1 


-- What I learned 
1) We could use RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY ORDER BY) to derive the largest counts.
